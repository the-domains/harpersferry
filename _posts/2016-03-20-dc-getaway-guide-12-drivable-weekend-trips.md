description: 'The West Virginia town is one big confluence — history and culture, mountains and rivers, urbane strollers and outdoorsy folks. The national historical park dominates the Lower Town, where the Potomac and Shenandoah rivers converge and Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia meet. The park spotlights seminal events including Civil War battles (and the revolving door of occupiers), the rise of industry and transportation, the arsenal raid by abolitionist John Brown and the movement to educate African Americans. Etsy-spirited boutiques, art galleries and snug cafes line Washington Street, the main drag, and outlying lanes. The area also has a spider’s web of hiking trails, including a section of the mother of all treks, the Appalachian Trail. The trail conservancy’s visitor center is a resource to all guests — long-distance marchers as well as day-walkers wearing flip-flops and carb-loading on waffle cones from Scoops.'
